Pig Dice Game
This project is a simple and interactive version of the Pig Dice Game, where two players compete to reach a certain score by rolling dice and holding their points. The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a straightforward and enjoyable experience.

Key Features:
User Interface (UI):

The game's UI is designed using HTML and styled with CSS. It features a clean and responsive layout with sections for player scores, current scores, and buttons to roll the dice, hold the score, or start a new game.
Gameplay Mechanics:

Players take turns rolling a dice. The roll result is added to their current score unless they roll a 1, which ends their turn and resets their current score.
Players can choose to "Hold" their score, adding their current score to their total score and passing the turn to the other player.
The game continues until one player reaches the winning score, at which point they are declared the winner.
Dice Roll Simulation:

The dice roll is simulated using JavaScript by generating a random number between 1 and 6.
The result of the roll is displayed as an image of the corresponding dice face.
Score Tracking:

The current and total scores for both players are tracked and updated dynamically in the UI.
Responsive Design:

The game layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
Winning Condition:

The game checks if a player's score has reached or exceeded the target score. If so, that player is declared the winner, and the game resets.
Technologies Used:
HTML: Structures the game's content and elements.
CSS: Provides styling for the game's interface, ensuring an appealing visual presentation.
JavaScript: Implements the game's logic, handling dice rolls, score updates, and player turns.
How to Play:
Start a New Game: Click "New game" to reset the scores and begin.
Roll the Dice: Click "Roll dice" to roll the dice and add the result to your current score.
Hold Your Score: Click "Hold" to add your current score to your total score and pass the turn to the next player.
Winning: The first player to reach the target score wins the game.
This project is an excellent example of how basic web technologies can be used to create a fun and interactive game. It offers a hands-on way to learn and apply concepts related to DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game mechanics.
